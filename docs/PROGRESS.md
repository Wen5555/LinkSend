# LinkSend implementation progress

Updated: 2026-09-08. This is an active implementation, not an accepted product release.

## Environment and limits

- Windows amd64, PowerShell 7, Go 1.26.5, Node 22.15.0, pnpm 11.19.0.
- The default PATH exposed MinGW-w64 GCC 8.1, which made Windows race binaries exit with `0xc0000139`. Scoop MinGW 16.2.0 is now installed and selected explicitly for race verification.
- Docker 29.2.1 client is installed, but the Linux engine is unavailable.
- Wails 2.15.0 is available at `.tools/bin/wails.exe`; WebView/macOS runtime validation is not available here.
- No production service, firewall rule, proxy, route, automatic deployment or push was performed.

## 2026-09-08 Hong Kong host connectivity preparation

- The reusable `hk-main` SSH alias was resolved and probed successfully (`root@109.66.88.204`, SSH port `60851`); a read-only host audit reported no failed systemd units and 22% root filesystem usage.
- The remote LinkSend rendezvous process is running from `/opt/linksend-lan-test/rendezvous` with `listen = "0.0.0.0:443"`, the configured origin certificate for `linksend.oooai.de`, and `relay=false`/QUIC capabilities. `GET /healthz` returned `status=ok` through both loopback and the public listener.
- coturn is running in STUN-only mode on UDP `3478`; no TURN allocation or relay port range is configured. nftables permits TCP `443` and UDP `3478` and retains a default-drop input policy.
- Windows reachability checks to `109.66.88.204:443` and `109.66.88.204:3478` succeeded. The origin certificate is self-signed but has SANs `linksend.oooai.de` and `*.oooai.de`; normal clients must use the Cloudflare edge hostname and must not disable certificate verification.
- Earlier check (superseded by the domain recheck below): DNS returned NXDOMAIN for both `linksend.oooai.de` and `stun.oooai.de`. Formal Windows/macOS WSS pairing and transfer testing is therefore pending the user's Cloudflare records: proxied `A linksend.oooai.de -> 109.66.88.204` and DNS-only `A stun.oooai.de -> 109.66.88.204`.

## Version control

The repository is managed with Git on `main`, tracks `https://github.com/Wen5555/LinkSend.git`, and has been pushed without force updates. Local identities, databases, build binaries, toolchains and temporary profiles are excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Source implemented | Current evidence | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Two Go modules, workspace, Wails template, configs, docs, CI and commands | Root tests/vet/race, CLI/devtool, and desktop GOWORK=off checks pass; desktop CI path corrected in source | CI runner confirmation |
| M1 | Pion ICE + quic-go UDP demux, TLS 1.3 pinning, timeout/close paths | Windows loopback host ICE, encrypted bidirectional QUIC, wrong-pin negative tests, benchmark and `demo-local` pass | Real two-host LAN, public IPv6 and controlled dual NAT not run |
| M2 | Ed25519 identity, invite pairing, SQLite group, WSS auth, presence/session routing, revoke and local trust | signaling package tests and demo control plane pass | Reconnect/backoff and multi-session coordinator |
| M3 | Manifest/BLAKE3/secure receiver plus shared direct session API and CLI send/receive | App service test completes paired profiles through WSS, ICE, TLS 1.3, QUIC and transfer; demo transfers 1 MiB with matching content hashes and no file-sized signaling forwarding | Real two-machine LAN, public IPv6 and cross-NAT |
| M4 | Chunk checkpoint/recovery, safe staging, pause/cancel primitives | transfer unit tests and real quic-go loopback cancellation lifecycle tests pass | Process-kill restart acceptance through app/session coordinator |
| M5 | Thin Wails binding to shared identity/devices/diagnostics | Desktop Go source, frontend checks and Windows Wails production build pass | Windows interactive, macOS runtime and task UI |
| M6 | Deployment examples, explicit STUN-only config, diagnostics and benchmark entry points | Compose config parses; STUN-only runtime and HTTPS identity are not run | Docker daemon, HTTPS certificates, STUN Binding/TURN Allocate negative test, NAT lab and package signing |

## Commands run in this milestone

Passed:

```text
gofmt -w internal/signaling/client_test.go internal/app/service.go internal/app/demo.go cmd/linksend/main.go cmd/rendezvous/main.go cmd/devtool/main.go apps/desktop/app.go
go test ./...
go test ./internal/signaling
go run ./cmd/devtool demo-local
```

`demo-local` reported authenticated TLS 1.3, `relay=false`, a direct loopback candidate pair, 1,048,576 file bytes and about 3,171 signaling-forwarded bytes. ICE library close logs mention closed sockets during cleanup; they do not change the result.

Not run or blocked:

- The old GCC 8.1 race attempt exited with `0xc0000139` before tests; it is retained as a toolchain failure, not a race result.
- Real two-machine LAN, cross-NAT srflx, public IPv6, Windows to macOS and Linux namespace NAT: no target topology/privilege available.
- Docker compose and production HTTPS: Docker Linux engine/certificates unavailable.
- Independent desktop module and frontend checks were run below; macOS runtime and interactive desktop acceptance remain pending.

Additional verification completed after the initial update:

- `go vet ./...`: passed.
- `GOWORK=off go test ./...` at the root: passed.
- With Scoop MinGW 16.2.0 selected via `CC`, `CXX` and `PATH`, `go test -race ./...` passed across all root packages and integration tests.
- `apps/desktop` with `GOWORK=off`: `go test ./...` and `go build ./...` passed.
- `apps/desktop/frontend`: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run test` (3 tests) and `pnpm run build` passed.
- Wails 2.15.0 production build passed and produced `apps/desktop/build/bin/LinkSend.exe` on Windows amd64.
- After shared direct-session changes, Wails production build was rerun and passed again.
- `go run ./cmd/devtool test-nat` correctly returned nonzero with an explicit Windows/Linux-privilege explanation.
- `go run ./cmd/devtool bench-transport` passed on this Windows host: native 102.18 MB/s, ICE integration 98.87 MB/s for one exploratory iteration; this is loopback evidence only.
- `docker compose -f deploy/compose.yml config` passed with an explicit bootstrap token; the Docker engine itself remains unavailable, so image build/start was not run.
- `internal/app.TestDirectServiceSendAndReceive` passed: two profiles used the shared `ConnectDirect`/`AcceptDirect` API and `SendFiles`/`ReceiveOnce` API for an authenticated transfer.
- `go run ./cmd/devtool check-core` now runs ordinary tests, vet and race tests; it passed with the installed Scoop MinGW 16.2.0 toolchain.

## Stage 1A current scope

- Source changes: coturn 4.6.2 now receives the explicit `stun-only` option; the compose healthcheck is documented as liveness only; desktop CI enters `apps/desktop` and prints `GOMOD/GOWORK`; reserved CLI task commands return `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` without dispatching to unrelated state-changing methods.
- This Stage 1A run must separately record root tests, desktop-module tests, frontend checks and compose parsing. Wails production build, HTTPS certificate validation, coturn runtime and real Windows/macOS LAN/NAT traversal are not implied by those checks. Real quic-go loopback cancellation lifecycle is separately covered by Stage 1B.
- Stage 1A is complete in source and local automated checks; Stage 1B below records the current lifecycle implementation and evidence. Real network acceptance remains separate.

## Stage 1B current scope

- `internal/transport.QUICStream` now keeps quic-go `CancelRead`/`CancelWrite` behind a small transport boundary. Transfer cancellation and protocol failure abort both stream directions; normal completion still uses `Close`.
- Candidate exchange now uses a phase context. The first terminal sender/receiver error cancels its sibling, parent cancellation is classified as `CANCELLED`, and a missing `end_of_candidates` is bounded by a candidate phase budget.
- Signaling establishment, candidate exchange, ICE checks and QUIC handshake retain separate cancellation/timeout boundaries. The existing `CHECK_TIMEOUT` code remains the ICE phase code; signaling and QUIC timeout causes are no longer intentionally collapsed into it.
- Real quic-go loopback tests cover blocked acceptance read, blocked receive read, blocked ACK wait, repeated abort, candidate sibling failure, missing end message, malformed message and parent cancellation. These are lifecycle tests, not LAN/NAT evidence.

## Locked versions

- Go 1.26.5, module minimum 1.26.0.
- Pion ICE v4.4.2, quic-go v0.62.0.
- modernc.org/sqlite v1.58.0, coder/websocket v1.8.15, go-toml/v2 v2.4.3, zeebo/blake3 v0.2.4.
- Wails 2.15.0, React 19.2.8, TypeScript 5.9.3, Vite 7.3.6, pnpm 11.19.0.

## Next concrete actions

1. After the two Cloudflare records resolve, run Windows to macOS real two-machine LAN acceptance with the Hong Kong rendezvous service and STUN. Preserve DirectEvidence, transfer hashes and failure-phase output.
2. Stage 2B: run different-network cross-NAT acceptance without relay.
3. Verify IPv6 and Linux interoperability.
4. Add persistent task orchestration, then Wails task UI, after real-network evidence is recorded.

## 2026-09-08 engineering optimization evidence

- Diagnostics now use a separate redacted identity DTO; health failures expose only a stable code/summary. Direct transfers can export read-only `DirectEvidence` from the selected ICE pair, endpoint counters and negotiated TLS/ALPN through the CLI `--evidence` flag.
- Transfer controls use typed operation constants and semantic validation. Accept/ack verified values are bounded, peer error detail is limited to 4 KiB and sanitized, frame limits reject invalid bounds, and progress rates are finite. Resume state parsing is bounded and rejects trailing JSON/unknown file IDs; fresh staging and checkpoint temporary files have best-effort cleanup. Cancellation persists `Cancelled`.
- ICE failures preserve cancellation, timeout, no-candidate and generic ICE failure categories. Signaling/QUIC wrappers retain underlying causes. Trust files are bounded; SQLite rejects unknown schema versions; server expiry cleanup and network closes avoid holding the mutex during websocket close.
- The root module path and desktop module path are now `github.com/Wen5555/LinkSend` and `/apps/desktop`; CI verifies modules with `GOWORK=off` and `go mod verify`. `devtool network-info` reports interface state/address data without credentials.

Verification on Windows amd64: root `gofmt`, `git diff --check`, `go mod verify`, `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go run ./cmd/devtool check-core` (including race), root and desktop `GOWORK=off` test/build, frontend typecheck/lint/test/build, Wails 2.15.0 production build, `demo-local`, and `network-info` passed. A 20x transfer repeat was first interrupted after an erroneous test harness blocked; the corrected transfer package passed its focused run. `test-nat` remains an explicit nonzero not-run result because this Windows host lacks the privileged Linux namespace fixture.

## 2026-09-08 domain recheck

- `linksend.oooai.de` resolves to Cloudflare addresses `172.67.208.195` and `104.21.45.36`; `stun.oooai.de` resolves directly to `109.66.88.204`.
- Windows STUN Binding request to UDP 3478 received an 88-byte success response with matching cookie and transaction ID. This is STUN reachability, not ICE/NAT acceptance.
- Public HTTPS `/healthz` returns Cloudflare 525. The source certificate is self-signed Ed25519; corresponding Cloudflare source connections fail with `tls: peer doesn't support any of the certificate's signature algorithms`. Origin-local HTTPS with the origin certificate explicitly trusted returns healthy capabilities and `relay=false`.
- `--server` must use `https://linksend.oooai.de`; the CLI converts HTTPS to WSS internally. Stage 2A commands have been corrected accordingly.
- No server configuration, certificate, firewall, or service was changed. Public pairing/transfer remains `BLOCKED_BY_EXTERNAL_ENV` until TLS is corrected and public HTTPS/WSS are verified.
- Read-only evidence: hk-main `/tmp/codex-ssh/linksend-domain-inspect-20260908T150418Z`.
## 2026-09-08 Cloudflare origin TLS repair

- Using the user-provided Cloudflare credential, an Origin RSA certificate for `linksend.oooai.de` was issued and installed on `hk-main`.
- Existing `/opt/linksend-lan-test/origin.crt`, `origin.key` and `server-public.toml` were backed up to `/root/linksend-lan-test-backups/20260908T151853Z/` before replacement.
- The rendezvous process was restarted with the same configuration. Public `https://linksend.oooai.de/healthz` now returns `status=ok`, `protocol_version=1`, `transport=quic`, `relay=false`.
- STUN remains available at `stun:stun.oooai.de:3478` (DNS-only). The certificate is valid for 7 days and must be renewed before `2026-09-15 15:12 UTC`.
- Verification job logs are retained at `/tmp/codex-ssh/linksend-origin-cert-rotate-20260908T151839Z`; rollback is restoring the recorded backup files and restarting the same rendezvous command.

## 2026-09-09 Stage 2A result

- Real Windows↔macOS LAN transfer passed. A 16 MiB random fixture completed through authenticated QUIC with TLS 1.3, `relay=false`, host candidates `10.234.49.250:62995` and `10.234.232.205:62109`, and 1,680 bytes of observed STUN traffic.
- Receiver and sender SHA256 values matched. Full evidence is recorded in `docs/STAGE2A-20260909.md`; sender output is under `.stage2a/20260909-000044/` and is ignored by Git.
- This closes the Stage 2A same-LAN evidence item. Cross-NAT, IPv6, different-network and desktop UI acceptance remain separate.
